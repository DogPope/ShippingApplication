# README.md for Shipping Application
**Note: I know the naming convention is wrong, my Lecturer demanded it be done this way.
She demanded Hungarian Notation, while I would have taken Microsofts advice and used the recommended naming convention.
An example of this is Form naming. E.g frmMain SHOULD be called MainForm.
